      <h1>All about Diego</h1>
      <p>
        Hello my name is Diego Aldas. I am a junior here at Babson College. To
        me home is New York city it is where most of my family that is here in
        the country lives. I am a big sports fan, particularly two sports one of
        them being the NBA and the second one being soccer. I am a Cleveland
        Cavaliers fan for the NBA and for soccer I am a huge FC Barcelona fan, a
        team I have been watching since 2014.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey here at Babson has been a very interesting one. I have had a
        great amount of fun and have done a great amount of learning as well. In
        terms of where this journey takes me I have declared a concentration in
        Data analytics and its one of the reasons why I am taking this course
        because it is an elective option but also because I have always been
        interested in coding and how to do it as a data analyst I am sure I
        would have to be comfortable with some part of the web and this course
        is something I am hoping will help me do that. Lastly, this year I was
        lucky enough to land an internship for this upcoming summer at Jp Morgan
        as a data analyst intern. In terms of the future I tend to fulfill the
        internship to the best of my abilities and hopefully receive a return
        offer for when I graduate.
