          Google Docs Fictional Project: This project is a fictional project
          that I created to practice my Google Docs skills because I am used to
          using Microsoft office. It is not a real project, but it helped me
          learn how to use Google Docs for document creation and collaboration.
          This image has no link because the project is a fictional project that
          I did not create.
